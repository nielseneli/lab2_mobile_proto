## General Feedback

### Bugs

- If the user enters a location that doesn't exist, the app hangs and becomes unresponsive.

### General comments

- Add/Edit/Delete all work and are persistent. Good job!
- Would have been a bit more intuitive if the locations got saved with a name automatically, ie, I search Boston, it gets named "Boston"
- A little unclear the user is supposed to search for a location. I initially thought that in the "Location" textbox the user is supposed to put their location name.
- When double clicking on the map I wanted stuff to happen (ie, be able to pin a location). I think that's because that's what happens in the Google Maps app.
- Pins can end up on top of eachother. Would have been cool if you somehow intelligently handled this.
- We would have loved to see you guys reach one of your stretch goals. It's awesome that you got core functionality working and mainly bug free (see above), but I think you guys could have accomplished a bit more in the two week timeframe you had.

### Coding practices

- I made some source code fixes that you should check out and incorporate on your future apps.
- Make sure you use strings.xml for all user-facing strings
- Remember to make sure you make things private! You only missed this once.


## Overall Grade

225/250

Great work guys!!!

## Lab Rubric(250 points total):

#### Proposal (15 points)
* 15 - You did the proposal and a teaching team member checked it off

#### Wireframes (35 points)
* 35 - You created wireframes for all fragments/screens of your app. You created a rough design of what your app will look like. You clearly outlined the workflow of your app (fragment transitions, how users navigate the app, where the user enters/receives information)

### Final Deliverable (200 points)
#### Functionality: 85 points
##### Completion: 70 points
* 70 - You implemented all of the required features in the assignment. The assignment is complete

##### Bug free: 15 points
* 10 - Your app has one or two bugs, occasionally causing unexpected behavior


#### Design/Usability: 20 points
* 15 - A small part of the app was unintuitive to interact with or it was a bit ugly.

#### Quality: 95 points

##### Git practices: 25 pts

* 25 - Separate branches were used for distinct features, master branch was kept “clean” and functional. Code was peer reviewed with pull requests before being merged.

##### Good coding practices: 25 pts

* 20 - Objects are intelligently designed and used where appropriate, inheritance used when appropriate, code is concise, naming conventions followed, proper access modifiers are used, public getters/setters are used instead of public variables except in one instance. We also would have liked to see use of strings.xml, as described above.

##### Readability: 25 pts

* 15 - Functions and variables are mostly named well. Code is occasionally confusing. Could use more comments. Some long lines.

##### Even work distribution: 20 pts
* 20 - You divided work fairly. Everyone had a significant contribution to your app.
